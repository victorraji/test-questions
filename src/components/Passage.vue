          Granulocyte colony stimulating factor receptor (G- CSFR) is a
          transmembrane cytokine receptor involved in the production of
          neutrophil granulocytes. Mutations in these receptors have been
          discovered in cancers, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and
          chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL). The aberrant signaling mechanisms
          of G-CSFRs, however, are poorly understood.

          Scientist shypothesized that understanding the downstream protein
          targets of mutant G-CSFRs might provide information about how G-CSFRs
          contribute to cancer. The researchers developed an assay to detect
          levels of p-STAT5 and p-ERK1/2 in the presence or absence of G-CSF for
          WT G-CSFR and T618I mutant G-CSFR. The results are shown in Figure 1.

        In subsequent experiments, the researchers tested other G-CSFR mutants,
        including a Q741n mutant, where “n” indicates any of the other 19 amino
        acids. They found that some substitutions led to increased signaling
        activity while other substitutions decreased all signaling activity. In
        the future, the researchers hope to find new downstream targets of
        cancer- relevant G-CSFR mutants.
